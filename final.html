                When deciding what to do for our final CSC 106 project it was kind of a challenge. We weren't sure whether certain ideas would be too difficult or too easy. So we decided to make a snake game, which at the time sounded not too hard or too easy. But, let me tell you it wasn't exactly a walk in the park. We all have played the classic game snake at least once in our lives, and personally a lot during highschool, especially during class. Too explain the game, the user starts a small snake on a gameboard, pretty much a dot. The goal of the game is to get as large as you can without dying by eating food. In our case the food is our bitmojis. The end goal at least in our game is to make it to a 100 score, without dying. You can die by either eating your own tail or touching the edge of the game board.
